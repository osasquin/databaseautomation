### Introduction
This Project involves implementing an example usage of persistence system for classes related to animals, at this case a Lamb, using Java, Maven, Hibernate, and MySQL. The project includes a terminal application to persist classes in the database and a window-based application using Java Swing for CRUD operations on a class with associative relationships.

### Description
The project consists of:
- 15 classes representing different categories of animals.
- Use of Hibernate for object-relational persistence.
- MySQL database for data storage.
- Terminal application for persisting all concrete classes.
- Window-based application with Java Swing for inserting, updating, and deleting data of a specific class with one or more associative relationships.
